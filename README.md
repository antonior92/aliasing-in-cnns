The folders in this repository contain two experiments:

1. [classifying-oscilations](./classifying-oscilations/README.md): toy example designed in order to assess the ability
    of convolutional neural networks to resolve between different frequencies at its input.
1. [quantifying-aliasing](./quantifying-aliasing/README.md): Scripts for quantifying to what extent aliasing takes 
    place in the intermediate layers of the neural network
